# Project Description

This project was created with Nuxt from the command: 
```bash
npx nuxi init <appName>
```
where appName is the name you want to give to your app.

Note that Nuxt works in tandem with Vue. Nuxt adds router capabilities to VueJS.

This project was built on top of the tutorial https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-7 to learn how to create and delete elements from a list using VueJS. Also, a small counter component has been added to show how the creation of components works.

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
